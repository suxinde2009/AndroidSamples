# App Actions Dynamic Shortcuts sample


## Description

This Android app manages items on to-do lists. Users can add items to
the to-do lists, search for items by category, and view information about
completed tasks. By implementing
[App Actions](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-actions/overview),
we allow the user to call upon our application to fulfill supported
[built-in intents (BIIs)](https://developer.android.com/reference/app-actions/built-in-intents)
in the [Common category](https://developer.android.com/reference/app-actions/built-in-intents/common).

By pushing [Dynamic Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-actions/dynamic-shortcuts)
to Assistant, you let users jump into a personalized place or bit of content in
your app, based on their past actions. These shortcuts are created at runtime
and are personalized to the user. Also, during contextually relevant times,
Assistant can proactively suggest your Android dynamic shortcuts to users,
displaying it on Assistant enabled surfaces.

*For example*, if youâ€™re building a note-taking app, you might push dynamic
shortcuts based on the given names of the notes that your users create.


This sample supports the following BIIs:
* `actions.intent.OPEN_APP_FEATURE`: Opens a specific feature in the app based
on the user query.
* `actions.intent.GET_THING`: Search and filter within the app using keywords.


This sample uses [Android Intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters)
for fulfillment.

_Note_: This sample application is a fork of the
[Android to-do sample](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples).

## Codelab Available
For detailed instructions on using this sample, use the `starter` directory
and refer to
[Extend dynamic shortcuts to Google Assistant with App Actions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/appactions-dynamic-shortcuts)
codelab for instructions.


## How to use this sample
Clone or download the project to your preferred location. Then, import and modify the project with
the following steps:

1. In Android Studio, select **Open an existing Android Studio project** from the initial screen
or go to **File > Open**.
2. Select `complete/` directory
3. Change the `applicationId` in [app/build.gradle](app/build.gradle) to the `applicationId` of
one of your draft or published apps in the Google Play Console.

    ```groovy
    android {
        defaultConfig {
            // This ID uniquely identifies your app on the device and in Google Play
            applicationId "PUT_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Sync files, manually sync by going to File > Sync Project with Gradel Files
5. Change the two (2) `android:targetPackage` in
[app/src/main/res/xml/shortcuts.xml](app/src/main/res/xml/shortcuts.xml) to the `applicationId` in
6. your [app/build.gradle](app/build.gradle).

    ```xml
    <capability android:name="actions.intent.GET_THING">
        <intent
            android:targetPackage="PUT_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE"
            >
        </intent>
    </capability>
    ```

    ```xml
    <capability android:name="actions.intent.OPEN_APP_FEATURE">
        <intent
            android:targetPackage="PUT_YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE"
            >
        </intent>
    </capability>
    ```


7. In Android Studio, find the root directory of the sample.
8. Select the `build.gradle` file.
9. Follow the instructions presented by the IDE.

Then, you can try the App Actions by following these steps:

1. Build and run the sample on your physical test device (**Run "app"**).
2. Open the App Actions test tool (**Tools > Google Assistant > App Actions Test Tool**).
3. Click **Create Preview**. Once your preview is created, the test tool window updates to display
information about BIIs found in your `shortcuts.xml` file.

After preview has been created:
1. **Create a new task** in the app with the title "New Item", any text in task area.
2. **Minimize app**, to see homescreen.
3. **Long click** on Assistant App until menu appears
4. Select **Settings**
5. Scroll down to All Settings and select **Shortcuts**
6. The shortcut "New Item" is listed
