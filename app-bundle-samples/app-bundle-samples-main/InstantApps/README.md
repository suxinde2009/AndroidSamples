# Android Instant Apps - Sample code collection

The samples in this repository demonstrate building and using APIs related to
[Android Instant Apps](https://d.android.com/topic/instant-apps).

## Getting started

Shared instructions on the samples are collected in this file.
For sample specific instructions, enter a sample's directory and
follow the corresponding README file.

## Available samples

`aab-simple` -> Basic instant app ready to be built into Android App Bundle.

`analytics` -> Usage of Firebase Analytics

`configuration-apk` -> Introduces Configuration APKs

`cookie-api` -> Usage of the Cookie API

`hello-java` -> Hello World written in the Java Programming Language.

`hello-kotlin` -> Hello World written in Kotlin.

`hello-feature-module` -> Hello World with feature modules

`install-api` -> Introduces Install API

`multi-feature-module` -> More complex feature module sample

`flavors` -> product flavors in an Instant App

`urlless` -> An instant app sample that doesn't require URL association.


## Running an Instant App sample

### From Android Studio

1. Select the `instant` feature module run configuration
2. Run the selected configuration

Some samples provide multiple entry points.
In this case you can choose which URL to use before starting the Instant App.

### From the command line (Android O+)

#### Find the build output

1. Run a gradle build `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
2. Locate the zip file containing the instant app.
2.1 This is usually located at `./instant/build/outputs/debug/instant-debug.zip`
2.2 Some samples contain flavors. In these cases the output path is different.
    These build output paths will be specified in the sample in question.

#### Run the Instant App

From the sample's root directory, execute

```
cd instant/build/outputs/apk/debug # navigate to build dir
unzip instantapp-debug.zip # extract apks
adb install-multiple -r -t --instantapp *.apk # install apks

# launch entry point; you'll have to replace $(SAMPLE_ENTRY_POINT)
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d $(SAMPLE_ENTRY_POINT)

cd - # takes you back to the root directory
```

### Code minification & obfuscation

Each sample's `minified` build type has code minification enabled.
In case API surfaces are being exposed to other modules, these surfaces are being explicitly excluded from
the obfuscation process through a proguard configuration file.
Take a look in a module's `build.gradle` file to see what is being done for that module.

#### Usage

From Android Studio
 * Open Build Variants
 * Change each variant to a "minified" variant
 * Run the "instant" configuration of the sample

From the command line
 * Assemble a minified build `./gradlew assembleMinified`
 * Navigate to `instant/build/outputs/apk/*/minified`
 * Run the instant app as described in the above section

Note: For samples containing flavors the paths & variant names will be slightly different.
