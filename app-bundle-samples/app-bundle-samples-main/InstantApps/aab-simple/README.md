# Android Instant Apps - Android App Bundle

This sample is ready to be built using Android App Bundle format and published via Play Console.

## Get your instant app ready
To get your instant app ready for Android App Bundle, make sure you
have set up `AndroidManifest.xml` correctly:
1. Amend `<manifest>` tag by adding the following:
```
xmlns:dist="http://schemas.android.com/apk/distribution"
```
2. Inside `<manifest>` tag, add the following declaration:
```
<dist:module
    dist:instant="true">
</dist:module>
```

Which would make your manifest look something like:
```
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:dist="http://schemas.android.com/apk/distribution"
    package="com.google.android.instantapps.samples.instantenabledandroidappbundle">

    <dist:module
        dist:instant="true">
    </dist:module>

    <application>
    ...
   </application>
</manifest>
```

3. In Android Studio, build the bundle: `Build` > `Generate Signed Bundle / APKâ€¦` > `Bundle`

4. On the Play Developer Console, only upload this bundle once to the installed track. For the
instant track, you can simply select "Add from Library" to import the already uploaded
instant-enabled bundle.
