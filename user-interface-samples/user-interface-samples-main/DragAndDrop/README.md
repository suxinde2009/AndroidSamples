# Drag and Drop Demo

## This is not an official Google product

An android application demonstrating basic Drag and Drop functionality using the
[`Jetpack Drag and Drop Library`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/draganddrop).

Allows for plain-text items and images to be dragged into the app. Has a plain-text item and a PNG
item that can be dragged within, out of, or to a second instance of the demo.

Utilizes [`androidx.core`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core)'s [`DragStartHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/view/DragStartHelper) 
and [`androidx.draganddrop`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/draganddrop)'s [`DropHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/draganddrop/DropHelper) to simplify
the process of implementing both dragging and dropping functionality.
