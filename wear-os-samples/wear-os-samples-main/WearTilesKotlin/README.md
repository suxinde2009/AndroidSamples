=================

<img src="screenshots/tile_messaging.png" height="400" />

[Tiles](https://d.android.com/training/wearables/tiles) provide easy access to the information and
actions users need in order to get things done. With a simple swipe from the watch face, a user can
find out the latest forecast or start a timer.

This repository contains a sample tile built using the [Tiles Material Components](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/tiles/material/package-summary)
library (for UI) and [Horologist Tiles](https://github.com/google/horologist#-tiles) (preview
utilities and Kotlin-friendly wrappers). 

It also showcases most of the Golden Tile layouts from the [Tiles Design Kit](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/design/tiles-design-system#tile-templates)
in the `tiles.golden` package of the `debug` sourceset. To see what these look like, open one of the
"GoldenTilesPreviewsRowN" files and choose the "Split" or "Design" editor view.

Get Started
-----------

Build the project from the command line using `./gradlew build` or import it into Android Studio to
benefit from the IDE shortcuts like direct surface launching which lets you launch the Messaging
tile directly to a device or emulator in just one click.

Layout samples from the Tiles Design Kit can be found in `GoldenTilesPreviewsRow[N].kt`. Open the
file in "Split" or "Design" mode to view the previews without a device or emulator.

For the sample, start with `MessagingTileService.kt`; the layout (with IDE preview) can be found in 
`MessagingTileLayout.kt`.
