WearSpeakerSample
================================

A sample that shows how you can record voice using the microphone on a wearable and
play the recorded voice, if the wearable device is connected to a speaker
(bluetooth or built-in). If you want to learn how to play media content on Wear OS, refer to 
[Horologist Media sample](https://google.github.io/horologist/media-sample/)

This sample is also written entirely with Jetpack Compose, using [Wear-specific components provided
by AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/wear-compose).
If you are looking for a simpler example of Compose on [WearOS], refer to [ComposeStarter](../ComposeStarter).

This sample doesn't have any companion phone app so you need to install this directly
on your watch using `adb` or Android Studio.
