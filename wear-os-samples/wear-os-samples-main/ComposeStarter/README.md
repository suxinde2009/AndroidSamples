Compose for Wear OS Starter Sample
==================================
Demonstrates a simple "Hello, World" starter project for using Compose with Wear OS.

Introduction
------------

Simple "Hello, World" app meant as a starting point for a new project using
Compose for Wear OS.

Displays a centered [Text] composable and a list built with [Horologist][horologist].

For more information on composable options in Compose for Wear OS, check out our
[documentation][documentation].

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project,
use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Designing for different display sizes
-------------------------------------

This sample demonstrates two techniques for helping you design for different display sizes:

1.  Compose [`WearPreviewDevices`][wear-preview-devices] and [`WearPreviewFontScales`][wear-preview-font-scales] annotations: These generate a set of previews in the preview pane within Android Studio, for a range of different screen sizes and font display size settings, allowing you to see how your design would look.

2.  Screenshot tests: This sample also demonstrates screenshot testing, for a set of [defined devices][wear-device]. For more information on screenshot testing, see this talk from [droidcon London][droidcon-talk].

    - To generate new images for the tests, run `./gradlew recordRoborazziDebug`
    - To test against existing reference images, run `./gradlew verifyRoborazziDebug`
  
Together, this allows you to check for any unexpected visual changes to your UI, across a range of device sizes.
