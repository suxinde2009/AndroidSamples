Android AppSearch Sample (Kotlin)
=======================

Features
--------

This sample showcases the following features of AppSearch:

 * Writing a document class with the AppSearch annotation processor
 * Setting an AppSearch database schema
 * Indexing documents into an AppSearch database

providing a query.
