# Activity Embedding

The activity embedding sample app is the basis of the activity embedding 
codelab.

The codelab guides you step by step through the process of implementing 
activity embedding two ways:

* Using an XML configuration file
* By making Jetpack WindowManager API calls

And you have the choice of working in Kotlin or Java.

## Background

Large displays enable app layouts and UIs that enhance the user experience and 
increase user productivity. But if your app is designed for the small displays 
of non-foldable phones, it probably doesnâ€™t take advantage of the extra display 
space offered by tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS devices.

Activity embedding enables you to optimize your activity-based apps for large 
screens. Introduced in Android 12L (API level 32), activity embedding displays
multiple activities onscreen simultaneously to create two-pane layouts such as
list-detail.

All without refactoring any existing code!

Learn how in the activity embedding codelab.
